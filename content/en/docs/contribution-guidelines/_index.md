# How to contribute

We're excited to have you consider contributing to our chaos! Contributions are always appreciated. 

# Krkn 

## Contributing to Krkn

If you would like to contribute to Krkn, but are not sure exactly what to work on, you can find a number of open issues that are awaiting contributions in
[issues.](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)

Please start by discussing potential solutions and your proposed approach for the issue you plan to work on. We encourage you to gather feedback from maintainers and contributors and to have the issue assigned to you before opening a pull request with a solution.

## Adding New Scenarios and Configurations

### New Scenarios 

We are always looking for new scenarios to make krkn better and more usable for our chaos community. If you have any ideas, please first open an issue to explain the new scenario you are wanting to add. We will review and respond with ideas of how to get started. 

If adding a new scenario or tweaking the main config, be sure to add in updates into the CI to be sure the CI is up to date.
Please read [this file](https://krkn-chaos.dev/docs/getting-started/#adding-new-scenarios) for more information on updates.

#### Scenario Plugin Development

If you're gearing up to develop new scenarios, take a moment to review our
[Scenario Plugin API Documentation](../developers-guide/scenario_plugin_api.md).
It’s the perfect starting point to tap into your chaotic creativity!

### New Configuration to Scenarios 

If you are currently using a scenario but want more configuration options, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues) describing your use case and what fields and functionality you would like to see added. We will review the sugguestion and give pointers on how to add the functionality. If you feel inclined, you can start working on the feature and we'll help if you get stuck along the way. 


## Work in Progress PR's 
If you are working on a contribution in any capacity and would like to get a new set of eyes on your work, go ahead and open a PR with '[WIP]' at the start of the tite in your PR and tag the [maintainers](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) for review. We will review your changes and give you sugguestions to keep you moving! 

## Office Hours
If you have any questions that you think could be better discussed on a meeting we have monthly office hours [zoom link](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/krkn?view=month). Please add items to agenda before so we can best prepare to help you.
